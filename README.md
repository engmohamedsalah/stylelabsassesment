## The solution consists of two projects.

  The GeneralKnowledge.Test project contains a number of tests to get a better understanding of
  the experience level of the applicant and covers various areas including string manipulation,
  XML processing and image conversion.

  The WebExperience.Test project is a MVC web application, in which the applicant is expected to
  achieve the objectives below:
  
  
  - API controller to perform all CRUD operations on the asset objects created as part of the CSV processing test
  - Visualize the assets in a paged overview showing for each asset the title and the created on field
  - Clicking one asset should navigate the user to a detail page showing all properties
  - data repository is permitted (for example Entity Framework)
  - Use a client MVVM framework, for example Angular
